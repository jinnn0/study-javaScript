/*
 * Scope
 * has to do with "variables"
 * scope is a "one way" street
 * inside code can reach outward for variables
 * but, outside code can't reach inward for variables

 * Context
 * has to do with objects
 * It refers to the object where the function belongs to
 * "this" keyword
 * In a method of an object -> "this" points towards the owner object
 * In a regular function -> "this" points towards the global "window" object (in strict mode "this" is undefined)
 * In an arrow function -> "this"
