/*
* var
* With "var", the variable declaration could be overridden.
* This becomes problem since this behavior doesn't throw an error
  and allow you to overwrite a variable that you didn't intend
  -> makes fixing bugs more difficu

* let & const
* Variable declaration
  * Variable with the same name can only be declared once.
* Scopes
  * Block scope
  
* const
* Has extra feature on top of let - constant value
* Once a variable assigned with const can not be reassigned
* Rrevents accidentally reassigning a variable
* Note : object, array, functions declared with const are still mutable
